The secure access to S3 files was successfully completed, ensuring a key feature of the application is ready for use. The initial Terraform setup is done, but there are still some issues that need to be addressed in the next sprint. Despite some delays in testing the contract upload functionality, the team worked collaboratively, completing all planned story points and delivering most features as expected. Overall, the sprint went well, with significant progress made toward the project\u2019s goals.\\n\\n## Sprint Burndown Chart\\n\\n![Burndown Chart](../../static/img/burndown_chart_sprint_4.png)"},{"id":"Sprint 3","metadata":{"permalink":"/communication_website/blog/Sprint 3","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-18-sprint_3/sprint_3.md","title":"Sprint 3","description":"From: 2024/11/05","date":"2024-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.64,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Tiago Gomes","url":"https://github.com/caridade1706","imageURL":"https://github.com/caridade1706.png","key":"tiago","page":null},{"name":"Sara Almeida","url":"https://github.com/SardinhaAlmeida","imageURL":"https://github.com/SardinhaAlmeida.png","key":"sara","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Sprint 3","title":"Sprint 3","authors":["tiago","sara"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Sprint 4","permalink":"/communication_website/blog/Sprint 4"},"nextItem":{"title":"Sprint 2","permalink":"/communication_website/blog/Sprint 2"}},"content":"import Architecture from \'@site/static/img/Architecure_before.png\';\\n\\n\\n**From**: 2024/11/05\\n**To**: 2024/11/18\\n\\n**Scrum Master**: Tiago Gomes\\n\\n**Product Owner**: Sara Almeida\\n\\n**Developers**: Mariana Perna, Roberto Castro\\n\\n## Sprint Goal\\n\\nThe goal for this sprint was to start developing the notification microservice so the landlord can invite tenants, through notification, to a house.

We felt like we weren\'t sure of the direction we were going and we really wanted to take time thinking what was indeed valuable to our application and to our users. This way, we didn\'t make any progress this sprint concerning the development of features. Instead, we took a step back and re-evaluated our priorities, besides digging deeper into learning about terraform.\\n\\nFrom this, we concluded that the *Task Management Microservice* was not a priority nor it was inovative to our users. We decided to focus on improving the *Houses Management Microservice* and creating a solid *Notification Microservice*. We still intent to have landlords and tenants, but we think that the features of adding and managing expenses and managing issues are more valuable to our users as landlords and having a unified place to see all the expenses is the most valuable and inovative feature to our tenants.\\n\\n<img src={Architecture} alt=\\"Architecture\\" width=\\"600\\" height=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\nThis way, from the backlog we had, Epics 2 and 4 will be removed and, for the next sprint, we will focus on continuing the development of the *Houses Management Microservice*. We feel like this was the best decision so we can deliver a more valuable product to our users."},{"id":"Sprint 2","metadata":{"permalink":"/communication_website/blog/Sprint 2","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-04-sprint_2/sprint_2.md","title":"Sprint 2","description":"From: 2024/10/22","date":"2024-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.075,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Mariana Perna","url":"https://github.com/MarianaPerna07","imageURL":"https://github.com/MarianaPerna07.png","key":"mariana","page":null},{"name":"Roberto Castro","url":"https://github.com/RobertoCastro391","imageURL":"https://github.com/RobertoCastro391.png","key":"berto","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Sprint 2","title":"Sprint 2","authors":["mariana","berto"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Sprint 3","permalink":"/communication_website/blog/Sprint 3"},"nextItem":{"title":"Sprint 1","permalink":"/communication_website/blog/Sprint 1"}},"content":"**From**: 2024/10/22\\n**To**: 2024/11/04\\n\\n**Scrum Master**: Mariana Perna\\n\\n**Product Owner**: Roberto Castro\\n\\n**Developers**: Tiago Gomes, Sara Almeida\\n\\n## Sprint Goal\\n\\nThe objective of this sprint is to make the entire landlord functionality operational and resolve any security issues.
