# ECS Deployment

## 1. Containerization with Docker
- Each microservice is containerized using Docker.
- A `Dockerfile` is created for each service, specifying:
  - The base image.
  - Dependencies and configurations.
  - Commands required to run the application.
- Docker images are built locally.

## 2. Amazon ECR Configuration
- ECR serves as the image repository where Docker images are stored.
- Each microservice has its own ECR repository, with images versioned accordingly.
- IAM roles are configured to allow ECS tasks to securely pull images from ECR.

## 3. ECS Cluster Setup
- An ECS cluster is created to manage services and is associated with a VPC for network settings (subnets, security groups).
- The cluster is configured to run serverlessly using AWS Fargate, eliminating the need for infrastructure management.

## 4. Task Definitions
- Each microservice is defined as an ECS task with a task definition that specifies:
  - The Docker image to use (referenced from ECR).
  - Resource allocation (CPU, memory).
  - Environment variables (e.g., database connections).
  - Networking settings (VPC, subnets, security groups).
  - IAM role permissions for accessing other AWS services.

## 5. Service Configuration
- An ECS service is created for each microservice, which:
  - Uses the task definition to launch and manage the desired number of tasks.
