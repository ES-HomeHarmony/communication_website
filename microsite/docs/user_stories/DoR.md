# Definition of Ready

## What is it

A Definition of Ready (DoR) works like a checklist that ensures a task or user story is ready to be worked on meaning it is a set of criteria that must be met before a product backlog item is ready for a sprint. The DoR is a way to ensure that the team has a shared understanding of what is required to deliver a user story.

## Our DoR for this project

- **Shared understanding within the team:** All team members have a clear understanding of the user story, its purpose and requirements. It helps avoiding miscommunication and estimating the effort required to complete its development.
- **Independent**: The backlog item being worked on should not depend on any other tasks avoiding unnecessary work and delays. 
- **Estimated effort agreed on**: The team agrees on the estimated effort, evaluated in story points, required to complete the user story.
- **Is valuable**: The user story is valuable to the customer and the team and the team understands that impact.
- **Determined that is feasible**: The team agrees that the user story is managable to be completed within the sprint.
- **Acceptance criteria is clear and testable**: Following the Given-When-Then format. It allows the team to know if the task is finally completed or not.
