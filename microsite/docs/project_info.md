# Project Description

## Home Task Management Application for Families or Groups

### General Objective:
Create a web platform that enables families or groups of friends to share and manage household tasks collaboratively. The application will also include features for managing household expenses, making group purchases, organizing events, and communicating with the landlord.

## Main Features:

### 1. Household Task Management
- Users can create household tasks (cleaning, cooking, etc.) and assign them to other household members.
- It will be possible to set completion dates and automatic task rotation (e.g., tasks change person every week).
- Completed tasks will award points to users as part of a rewards system, encouraging collaboration.
- Tasks will be visible on a calendar, and members will receive automatic notifications via email, reminding them of their responsibilities.

### 2. Reward System for Completing Tasks
- When users complete tasks, they earn points that can be exchanged for rewards within the application (e.g., task breaks or privileges like choosing a movie for a group viewing).
- The rewards system is based on accumulated points, and household members can view their ranking according to completed tasks.
- This system motivates users to participate more in household tasks, creating a gamified dynamic within the application.

#### Points System:
- Each task will have a specific number of points awarded to the user as tasks are completed. 
- The system will allow users to "purchase" rewards with a set number of points, considering that there will be a maximum number of points that can be spent each month.

### 3. Shopping and Inventory Management
- A shared shopping list will be available to all household members, where they can add items that need to be purchased.
- When an item is bought, the user can mark it off, and the history will be updated to avoid duplicate purchases.
- This feature also allows tracking who last bought certain items for better responsibility management.

### 4. Expense and Landlord Management
- The landlord will have a profile in the application where they can add the monthly household expenses (e.g., water, electricity, gas).
- The system automatically splits these expenses among the residents, notifying them about the amount they need to pay.
- Each resident can confirm the payment of their share, and when everyone has confirmed, the landlord will receive a notification informing them that the total amount has been paid.
- There will be a section where each resident can view their total balance (all paid and unpaid expenses), ensuring transparency and financial control.
- It will be possible to upload invoices or receipts (in PDF or image format), both by the landlord (to prove expenses) and by the residents (to justify payments).

### 5. Reservation of Common Areas
- Users will be able to reserve common areas of the house (e.g., the living room or kitchen) for events, such as dinners or meetings.
- When scheduling an event, all household members receive a notification to accept or decline the reservation, avoiding scheduling conflicts.
- This feature will be integrated into the calendar, allowing everyone to see the scheduled events and participate in decisions regarding the use of the spaces.

### 6. Notifications and Reminders
- The system will send automatic notifications to remind users of their pending tasks, space reservations, and monthly expenses.
- Notifications can be sent via email or directly in the application, ensuring that users are always up to date.
