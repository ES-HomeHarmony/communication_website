## Sprint Retrospective

For this sprint, we planed to start the development of the tenant side of the application. We were not able to complete any of the stories planned for this sprint. The team faced the big challenge of lack of time due to other university projects and unplanned problems that came from these last mentioned ones. We will catch up on the next sprint and we are very confident that we will be able to deliver the stories planned for this sprint.
