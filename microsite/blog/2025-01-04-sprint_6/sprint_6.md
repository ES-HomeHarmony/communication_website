## Sprint Retrospective

We were able to successfully meet the sprint goal by completing the inviting tenants logic, the issues submission and visualization functionalities, and finalizing the tenant dashboard. The team worked collaboratively to address the tasks and user stories, ensuring that all features were implemented according to the acceptance criteria. Additionally, the bug related to the tenant role in the user microservice was fixed. We still need to improve our CD Pipeline has we are having some problems with the deployment of the services which will be a focus for the next sprint.
